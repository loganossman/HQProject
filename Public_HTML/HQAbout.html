                    <p class="aboutPara">I am an artist that uses realistic portraiture to depict the complex human body. I originally worked only in black and white, now I am gradually adding color into my works using a variety of different materials to better emphasize my drawings. I start by taking photos of myself and other willing models, then project my photos onto a flat surface to draw a rough outline of the person/people I want onto my surface. Next, I take those outlines away from the projector and use the original photo as a reference until the portrait or portraits are complete. <br> <br>

                        Most of my work involves taking my own photos of myself as the main model, as my previous work focused on my own emotions dealing with my disability, epilepsy. After finishing my recent works, I wanted to move away from the serious topic of disability and move onto a lighter topic: family. For a while now, I have had the idea to create a series where I collect family photos and compare them to each other to see our resemblances to one another. I choose these photos carefully by picking ones that I can easily line up together through a specific point (i.e. an eye or the nose) or photos that have similar features. Family is a topic I hold near and dear to me and I wanted to show just how crazy it is that family members can look more like one another than we choose to let on, thus inspiring me to start this line of work. Through this series, I want to share more of myself by showing off my family and seeing the different elements from both sides of my family reflect through the generations.
